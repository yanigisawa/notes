# IWS Christmas Concerts

2 Concerts on December 5th, 2 and 7pm at the Palladium, and December 15th at Mooresville HS

## Nutcracker Swing

- Make sure to count carefully and come in after F…we don’t all play at the same time here.
- J…first note is only played the 2nd time.
- M will be conducted in 4
- In general, just watch Charlie very carefully for all tempo changes.

## Sleigh Ride

- Just remember that this will go faster than we played it on Thursday.

## Merry Christmas Darling

- Pretty straight forward…observe all dynamics and shaping marks very carefully. Watch for the tempo changes from 56 to the end.

## Christmas Sing-Along

- 77..we play I Saw 3 Ships THREE times.
- 95…tricky change of beat. We will be in ONE here. Watch!
- Ending; play the ending that is written by hand in your part. Ask if you have questions here.

## Fantasia on Greensleeves

- Biggest concern here is Balance…we can’t cover the harp.

## Spirit of Christmas

- Lock in the opening 16th notes…it helps to tongue the first note of each measure as it is written.
- At 93…Tempo will be at 90
- 101…WATCH Nathan here…phrases will be stretched.

## Christmas March

- In the 1st part, don’t play the smaller upper notes throughout the piece. Nancy Frass does a great job on the Eb here.
- Lots of key changes…mark them in.
- 206 cross out the repeat.
- Cross out the Optional short coda ending and take the FINALE.

## Let it Go

- We are pros on this one. We will just need to be sure to not cover up Jessamyn.

## O Holy Night

- 2nds and 3rds should NOT play their triplet parts when the harpist is with us.
- As I recall, you generally have come back in at 85 in the past but we will have to wait until Melissa is with us to confirm that.
- Play the ending that is penciled in and not the printed ending. We will end in measure 104 with three written F’s

## Christmas Festival

- Just a few reminders on this one as we have all played this one many times.
- No Rit 2 measures before square 3.
- Stagger breathing on Silent Night at #8 so as to have no breaks.
- Five before square 9 there will be a brief break before the next measure…mark this one in and watch carefully.
- Square 9 pick up the newer faster tempo right off the bat
- Square 11…play this softly and make it sound like an old Viennese music box.
- Watch for a rit. right before square 14.

## Carol of the Drum

- Not really anything to say here.

## White Christmas

- There will be several switches between 4/4 and Cut time here even though it is written in 4/4. Just watch carefully and observe all dynamic markings. We don’t want to cover up Jessamyn.

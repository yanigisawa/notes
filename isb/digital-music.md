# Getting Started: Using iPad for Reading Music in Bands

Most of this article will instruct folks how to utilize the iPad effectively for reading music during rehearsals and performances, particularly through apps like Newzik and ForScore.

# Android Alternatives

If you don't own an iPad, there are Android alternatives. Android tablets may be preferable for their lower price point than iPads. These apps have not been tested by ISB members, but do look promising from their websites.

# iPad Apps

In order to be able to add markings to your music, you'll need to use an app that allows for annotations. The standard PDF reader in the iPad is read-only, so you'd be unable to add annotations, or cuts etc. in the music which may be required for a given performance.

Two apps that I've used for reading music during rehearsals and performances are [Newzik](https://newzik.com/) and [forScore](https://forscore.co/). Both apps are available on the App Store. Newzik is a free download but requires a subscription for all features, while ForScore is a one-time purchase. Both apps have roughly the same features, but they have their own interface for displaying each of the features. These days I prefer Newzik for the way it can organize multiple parts within a piece. That is, I can create a piece in my library, e.g. "Lord of the Dance", and I can make separate parts within that piece for "Clarinet 1", "Clarinet 2", etc. for each part that I've played within a given piece. I have not found an equivalent organizational feature in ForScore. Likely I'd have to use multiple pages within the same piece, or use separate pieces that are tagged or named with each part name.

## Page Turning

One of the biggest adjustments I had to make when using an iPad for music was getting used to the half-page turn. Both Newzik and ForScore have this as an option, and I'd recommend it to most folks to turn on. (it's not on by default) The half page turn will turn the **top half** of the screen to show the next page of music, while the bottom half remains on your current page. Now that I'm used to using an iPad for music, I have to remember how "normal" paper music works on the occasions that I'm using regular paper.

Another GOTCHA I've run into is when the roadmap for a piece is complex. Specifically if there is a D.S., Coda, or a repeat that spans multiple pages. Each piece will be different and will require a bit of adjustment based on how the music is laid out. Both Newzik and ForScore offer a "rearrange" feature of the music that allows for copying pages, changing order of the pages, or even cropping pages given the need. This allows the musician to customize the music to suit the needed roadmap for the piece.

### Newzik

[Newzik](https://newzik.com/) is my preferred digital music reader. As I mentioned above, nearly all of the features are in ForScore, so the difference is largely aesthetic. The app offers a free download, but allows limited number of pieces in your account. You'll have to pay a monthly fee to allow for additional pieces and to scan additional parts per piece.

The one feature I've identified in Newzik is how individual "Parts" are organized within a piece. As the ISB librarian, it has helped me keep track of all parts within a piece, and allows for easy export of a piece all at once.

See their [official tutorials](https://academy.newzik.com/collections/for-musicians/) for more information and see how to get started using it.

### ForScore

[ForScore](https://forscore.co/) is an alternative to Newzik for reading music on an iPad and keeping all the music digitally. One benefit to using forScore is that the app is available for a single purchase price, rather than a subscription. The app is $19.99 on the App Store.

As mentioned above, forScore offers nearly all of the same features as Newzik, with the exception of how individual parts can be organized within a piece of music. If you double on different instruments, or play different parts within a musical group, you may find your library becomes cluttered with different versions of the same piece since you'll need to keep track of each part for each piece separately.

### Getting Started: Step-by-Step

1. **Acquire the Necessary Equipment**: Ensure you have an iPad and download either Newzik or ForScore from the App Store.

2. **Import Your Music Sheets**: Transfer your band's music sheets in PDF format to the app's library. Use the "Import" feature of each app.

3. **Explore App Features**: Familiarize yourself with the app's interface, including navigation, annotation tools, and organizational features.

4. **Annotate and Organize**: Start annotating your music sheets, add comments, markings, and organize them using metadata or tags for easy access. Both apps allow for using "stamps" (from forScore) and "symbols" (from Newzik) to annotate your music. These are great for marking flats, sharps, etc. in your music since they offer finer grained control of the position of the marking.

5. **Practice and Perform**: Utilize the apps during band practices and performances, taking advantage of collaborative features and annotation tools.

## Seat Assignments

For reference, here are the current suggested seat assignments. This list
is not meant to be "the only way" you are to sit. Consider this a guide
to indicate which row you should sit in, and roughly how many other folks
will be sitting around you.

The flute and oboe sections take the entire first row, so the Clarinets now
start on the second row, stage right. (to the conductor's left)

2nd Row, starting from the end:

- Kaz Chan
- Jim DeCaro
- Nancy Frass

3rd Row, starting from the end:

- Ed Kingsley
- Mary Bowman
- Jennifer Tetzlaff
- Jennifer Sherbak
- James Alexander
- Andy Lamke
- Susan Hungerford
- Dennis Schafer
- John Wood

Bass Clarinets are in the 2nd row, middle, just inside of the
two bassoon players.

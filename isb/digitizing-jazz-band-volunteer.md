# Digitizing Jazz Band Music - Volunteer

Thank you for volunteering to help inventory the Jazz band music in the ISB library! This document will help you understand the process and what you can expect on the day of the event.

## What To Bring With You

1. **Smart Phone** - You will be using your smart phone to take pictures of the music. Make sure your phone is charged and has enough storage space for the pictures.
2. **Comfortable Clothes** - You will be on your feet for most of the day, so wear comfortable clothes and shoes.
3. **Water Bottle** - Staying hydrated is important, so bring a water bottle with you.
4. **(Optional)** - Light source, such as a small flashlight or headlamp, in case the lighting in the library is not sufficient. The flash on the camera phone may be sufficient, but it's always good to have a backup.

## Volunteer Day

### 1. **Arrival**

Please arrive between 12:45 and 1:00pm at Warren Central High School, door 36. Because there is little cell service in the library, it is unlikely that I'll receive a text from you if you're running late. Please plan accordingly.

### 2. **Taking Pictures**

When you arrive, you will be given a stack of music and a stack of pre-labeled folders. Your task is to take a picture of each piece of music, including the inventory number from the pre-labeled folder. The inventory number should be in the upper right corner of the image. Make sure the picture is clear and readable. These pictures will be used to read the following information from the music:

1. Inventory Number
2. Title
3. Composer
4. Arranger
5. Publisher (Often on the bottom of the music)

Make sure all corners of the page have good lighting on them, (thus the optional light source recommended above) and the resulting image has readable text on it.

### 3. **Filing**

After taking a picture of the music, place it in the appropriate pre-labeled folder, and file it in the appropriate file cabinet. The file cabinets are labeled with the same inventory numbers as the folders.

### 4. **End of Day**

At the end of the volunteer day, the pictures will need to be shared. If you are an iOS (iPhone) user, you will Airdrop the photos to James Alexander. If you are an Android user, you will upload the photos to a pre-shared public Google drive folder. Due to poor cell service in the library, you will need to be outside of Warren or at home to do this. We'll work until either 4:00pm or until all the music has been photographed.

## Thank You!

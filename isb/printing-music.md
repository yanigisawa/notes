# Things You May or May Not Already Know About Printing Music

Standard paper that is distributed for home use is 20lb paper. This is great for "normal" uses like printing letters, term papers, etc. However when needing a piece of paper to "stand up" on a music stand and not be blown over by someone walking past, it is better to use a higher weight paper. 


Most at home printers can comfortably print using **28lb paper.** Some of the heavier pieces of music distributed from the ISB library were printed on 32lb paper. However, some home printers do not support this heavy weight paper. Therefore, we recommend using 28lb paper. This weight paper is available both at office supply stores (Office Depot) and at general stores like Wal-mart and Meijer. Note however that the 20lb paper is far more common than heavier paper, so be careful when identifying the weight of the paper before making a special purchase.

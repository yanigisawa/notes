# Digitizing Jazz Band Music

## Goal 

The ISB seeks to inventory the existing file cabinets full of Jazz band music. At present no information is known about any of the pieces of music, other than that these physical file cabinets contain jazz band music. 

## Proposed Solution

A phased divide and conquer approach can be used to digitize the inventory from these physical file cabinets

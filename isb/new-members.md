We rehearse Tuesday nights at 7:00 pm at [Warren Central High School](https://goo.gl/maps/6rePhJWkf8vkZtvF8). Enter through the south side of the building off of 16th street in door #36.
Note: The doors automatically unlock at 6:30pm, and **re-lock again at 7:30pm.** Make sure you have your section lead's cell number
in case you are locked out.

The exact rehearsal room in Warren High School location can vary. Generally we rehearse in the band room. After entering door #36 continue straight into the hallway in front of you. The band room will be the first door on the right.

Keep an eye on the schedule of the group at [indyband.org](https://indyband.org/rehearsal-schedule). New performances and rehearsals will be listed there as the official schedule for the group.

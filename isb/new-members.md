# New ISB Member Info

We rehearse Tuesday nights at 7:00 pm at Warren Central High School. Enter through the south side of the building off of 16th street in door #36.
Note: The doors automatically unlock at 6:30pm, and **re-lock again at 7:00pm.** Make sure you have your section lead's cell number
in case you are locked out.

The exact rehearsal room in Warren High School location can vary. Generally we rehearse on the stage. After entering door #36 turn left, go past a set of double doors, and the stage is on the right.

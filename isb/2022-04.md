## Setlist to be Chosen Among

* *Hoagy Carmichael in Concert*
  * Mostly read the ink on this one, no major deviations from what's written
  * We play 101 on the 2nd time only
  * Watch out for the keychange (A-flats) starting at 135
* *Indianapolis News Newsboys March*
  * Stacatto 16th notes at box C, accented quarter notes
  * At the trio (measure 39) we play 1 per part
  * All players play at box F
* *Cole Porter, A Symphonic Portrait*
  * Read the ink (carefully) on this one. Notably:
  * Several key changes
  * Circle 241 to be conducted in 1
  * Circle 245, I recommend "Orange" here, but Hilmer will have to clarify (#dadJoke)
* *Indiana State Band March*
  * Standard March structure
  * Instead of starting ff, start mf and crescendo the first 4 bars.
  * 3 Bars before the first 1st ending, add a breath mark after the dotted-quarter note. Make a clear separation here.
  * If the Trio isn't marked on your parts, it is the dobble bar after the second, 2nd ending. (when we add a flat to the key signature)
  * Add Crescendos 6-7 measures after the trio, and 14-16 (ending just before the last repeat sign)
  * Bring out the 8th note run in the last four bars
* *Indiana Guards*
  * Read the ink on this one
  * If you're me, mark the E-flats starting the trio so you don't miss them next time.
* *The Hoosier*
  * Standard march structure
* *Michael Jackson: Through the Years*
  * Just a fun medley of MJ Tunes.
  * Note: we should endevor to "round the corners" (i.e. be less square when playing this one)
  * Tempo will go faster at box 120
* *Belle of Indiana*
  * March structure
  * Note the ending has a break strain, that goes back to the sign at the Trio.
* *Way Back Home Again in Indiana*
  * Read the ink
  * Don't cover the soloists starting at box 49-73
* *The best of John Mellencamp*

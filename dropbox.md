### Chrome on a Mac

If you used Chrome to download the files, a new folder will be created in your "Downloads" folder. The name of the new folder will depend on how the music has been shared. In the screenshot below, the folder is named "shared_music". Open that folder to see all of the PDFs you can open and download.

### Microsoft Edge

If you Microsoft Edge to download the Dropbox folder, an new .zip file will be downloaded to your "Downloads" folder. You can use the "Show in Folder" to open Windows Explorer directly to your Downloads folder:

### Extracting From .ZIP

You'll need to extract the contents of the .zip file to see the PDF files. Right-click on the .zip file and select "Extract All" to extract the contents of the .zip file.

A new window will open asking where you want your extract music to be placed. You can pick the default. This will make a new folder with the same name as the .zip file, and all of the PDFs will be in that folder.

You can now open the PDFs in your favorite PDF reader, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader, or in a music reader like Newzik or forScore.

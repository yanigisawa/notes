## December 15th, 2021 Concert Notes

### Christmas Typtich

**1st movement** 

Read straight through

**2nd Movement** 

* Will be conducted in 6 unless otherwised marked. (i.e. circle 3 in 3/4) 
* Pay close attention 7 measures from the end where there is a measure of 3/8.

**3rd Movement**

* 10 measures after circle 5, play piano, then crescendo 3 measures later.

### Deck The Halls with Boughs of Holly

* Practice the Soli's at Box 17 and 3 after 49.
* Similarly practice the 16th note runs from box 69 through 89. Ideally we'd get that as cleanly as we can with staccato articulation throughout.

### Go Tell it on the Mountain

* Play all dynamics as marked.
* Note the subito piano and crescendo at measure 70

### Charlie Brown Christmas

* Box 37 will be conducted in 1. There will be no cut-off after the fermada, so be ready to jump straight into the 8th notes
* Watch for the Rallentando after box 82

### A Family Christmas

* Will be conducted in 4/4 time throughout. My 3rd clarinet part had cut-time marked as several locations.
* Be careful of the Key changes at box 51 and 82
* Last 6 measures will ritardando and will fade away (i.e. no hard cut-off, but softly fading the music to nothing)
